# Delivery-Market-Modeling
**Overview**

In this analysis, I have delve into the delivery data provided by Delhivery, a prominent player in the Indian logistics market. Delhivery is focused on enhancing the quality, efficiency, and profitability of its business through data intelligence and capabilities. We have undertaken the task of understanding and processing this data to ultimately aid the data science team in building forecasting models.

Analysis and data preparation can be summarized into the following key steps:

**1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**

In this initial phase, we worked on preparing the data for analysis and modeling. Key actions taken during this stage include:

- Loading the data: We imported the dataset from the `delhivery_data.csv` file, allowing us to work with the data efficiently.

- Handling missing data: We examined the dataset for any missing values in various columns and decided on an appropriate strategy for dealing with them, which may involve imputation or removal of affected records.

- Data type conversion: We converted relevant columns, such as timestamps, into the appropriate data types to facilitate analysis and modeling.

- Dropping irrelevant columns: We identified columns that did not contribute to our analysis goals, such as 'is_cutoff,' 'cutoff_factor,' 'cutoff_timestamp,' 'factor,' and 'segment_factor,' and removed them to simplify the dataset.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

EDA is a crucial step to understand the dataset's characteristics and unveil initial insights. Our EDA involved:

- Analyzing the distribution of the target variable: We examined the distribution of key variables such as 'segment_actual_time' or 'actual_time' to identify patterns and outliers.

- Correlation analysis: We conducted correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable, helping us identify potentially significant predictors.

- Time-based trends: We visualized time-based trends in the data, including patterns related to the day of the week and hour, to uncover temporal variations.

- Categorical feature analysis: We explored the distribution of categorical features, such as 'route_type,' to identify any patterns or imbalances.

**3. Feature Engineering:**

Feature engineering is crucial for enhancing model performance. We created new features to aid in forecasting and analysis. These included:

- Time-related features: We extracted day of the week and hour information from timestamps, which could be used to capture time-related patterns in deliveries.

- Average speed: We calculated the average speed of deliveries by dividing 'actual_distance_to_destination' by 'actual_time,' providing insights into the efficiency of deliveries.

- Delay identification: We computed the difference between 'actual_time' and 'osrm_time' to identify instances of delays in deliveries.

- Ratio feature: We created a ratio feature by dividing 'actual_time' by 'osrm_time,' which could highlight the extent to which actual delivery times deviate from estimated times.

**4. Forecasting Models:**

To assist the data science team in building forecasting models, we prepared the dataset with relevant features and performed model development. Some of the potential models that could be considered include:

- Time Series Forecasting: Models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or Prophet could be applied to predict delivery times based on historical data and time-related features.

- Regression Analysis: Linear regression or more advanced regression techniques might be employed if multiple features influence delivery times.

**5. Model Evaluation:**

To assess the performance of the forecasting models, we employed appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc. Cross-validation techniques were used to ensure robustness and reliability.

**6. Important Feature Visualization:**

Visualization of critical features and model results is crucial for conveying insights effectively. We created visualizations that highlighted the significance of key features and the model's ability to capture delivery time variations.
